## About the mpx name

mpx is not an acronym, and is used by thePlatform with capitals in all-caps
sentences. This makes for some odd displays in Drupal, that generally expect
title case or sentence case. When referring to mpx within the user interface
and in strings, use lower case such as 'the mpx User entity'.
